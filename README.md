## MealsAPI
This App allows to fetch meals and their details from two endpoints using swift concurrency(async/await) in a MVVM architecture:
* [Dessert](https://themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/filter.php?c=Dessert)
* [Meals Details](https://themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/lookup.php?i=MEAL_ID)

## Technology Used
* Swift
* SwiftUI
* Async/Await
* MVVM
* XCTest

## Key Features
Meals App fetches a list of desserts in a smooth user-friendly UI built with swiftUI and displays details for each dessert with instructions on how to prepare the dessert,
with all the ingredients needed. despite my expertise with Combine framework, I implemented async/await concept to ensure a smooth user experience. 
all the business logic is fully unit-tested
